- [ ] convert cl_logger.js to lua, and stop it when not in `monitorMode`
- [ ] try again the upgrade to Discord.js v12
- [ ] Add `<fivem://connect/xxxxx>` to `/status` by getting `web_baseUrl` maybe from the heartbeat
- [ ] add a commend system?
- [ ] add stopwatch (or something) to the db functions and print on `/diagnostics`
- [ ] change webserver token every time the server starts

NOTE: when opening a player from the offline list, disable ID-requiring actions like dm,kick,warning

> Soon™®
- [ ] tweak dashboard update checker behavior
- [ ] add some chart to the players page?
- [ ] add an fxserver changelog page
- [ ] Social auth provider setup retry every 15 seconds
- [ ] show error when saving discord settings with wrong token
- [ ] break down playerController into separate files?
- [ ] rename playerController to playerManager?


## "in the roadmap"
- [ ] Auto updater for txAdmin?
- [ ] Check config management libraries (specially 'convict' by Mozilla and nconf)
- [ ] Add "discord client id" in the admin settings, this would enable "/kick @user"
- [ ] revisit the issue with server restarting too fast (before close) and the the bind failing, causing restart loop. Almost all cases were windows server 2012.
- [ ] xxxxxx

### Global vs Individual Modules
- Global
    - authenticator
    - discordBOT
    - logger
    - webserver
    - translator
    - players db (new)
    - config global (new)

- Individual
    - fxrunner
    - monitor
    - configvault

### Global vs Individual Pages
- Full Dashboard: Each row will be be one server, with: controls, stats (players, hitches, status), player chart
- Players
- Diagnostics: host + processes + multiple individual server info
- Admin Manager
- txAdmin Log
- Global Settings
- Servers:
    - live console
    - resources
    - log
    - cfg editor
...and maybe more, but now I'm going to sleep



Questões:
- É possível tirar o webserver pra fora do txAdmin?
    - Teria que tirar o verbose pra fora
    - Criar um metodo pra setar rotas full + atachar socket.io
    - Puxar o Authenticator pra fora
- É possível mudar as rotas depois?
    - Sim
- É possível Puxar o autenticator pra fora?
    - Sim
- É possível só iniciar o txAdmin depois?
    - Sim
- Isso vai deixar o código muito zuado?
- Vai valer a pena?
